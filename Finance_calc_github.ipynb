    "1. Investment:\n",
    "   - Asks the user to input deposit amount.\n",
    "   - Asks the user for the interest rate.\n",
    "   - Asks the user how many years they are investing for.\n",
    "   - Asks the user if the interest type is simple or compund.\n",
    "   - Based on these options, calculates and outputs the final amount after interest is accrued.\n",

    "   - Asks the user to input the monetary value of the house.\n",
    "   - Asks the user to input the interest rate.\n",
