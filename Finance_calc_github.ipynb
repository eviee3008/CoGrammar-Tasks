    "This Python program asks the user to choose whether they would like to calculate the interest they will earn on an investmenr, or calculate the amount they would have to pay on a home loan/mortgage. Here is what the program does according to these two options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Investment:\n",
    "   - Asks the user to input deposit amount.\n",
    "   - Asks the user for the interest rate.\n",
    "   - Asks the user how many years they are investing for.\n",
    "   - Asks the user if the interest type is simple or compund.\n",
    "   - Based on these options, calculates and outputs the final amount after interest is accrued.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Bond (a.k.a. mortgage/loan)\n",
    "   - Asks the user to input the monetary value of the house.\n",
    "   - Asks the user to input the interest rate.\n",
    "   - Asks the user how many years it will take to repay the loan.\n",
    "   - Based on these option, calculates and outputs what the monthly repayments amounts will be to repay the loan.\n",
